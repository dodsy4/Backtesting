# Backtesting
Project 8: Backtesting
"In this projec I have built a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester performs a portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs,
and I have implemented it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. I have also used performance attribution to identify the major drivers
of my portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL). I have left notes where further customizations are possible but not yet completed"
